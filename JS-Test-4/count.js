Given an integer array, find all the elements which are divisible by the index position in which they are present. Consider the index of array starts from 1

Input Format : An array arr

Output :Return number of integers which are divisible by its index (Assume that the index start from 1 and not 0)

Sample Input: [1, 5, 7, 8]
Sample Output: 2

Explanation: Consider that the index starts from 1 so, 1%1=0 , 5%2 = 1, 7%3 = 1, 8%4 = 0 , only 2 elements are divisible by their index
